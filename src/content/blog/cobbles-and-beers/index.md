Finlay and I never really knew each other growing up. Chamonix is a small place, so naturally, I had heard of him. The Irish kid that came and left, was here in the summer or over Christmas but never as much as the friends of mine that lived in the valley full-time. It was only during COVID when I got to know him. He and I had both come back to our family homes to spend lockdown in the mountains. As the restrictions loosened, a group of friends would meet up to ride bikes up and down the valley. Bars were shut, the volleyball court was shut, house parties weren't allowed. This riding group became one of the main ways to meet up with friends to have a chat and a socially distanced coffee.

Fin has become one of my best friends. We share ideas, concerns, opinions. Last week we went on a bike trip through Flanders.

I've always wanted to ride in Flanders as it's a legendary cycling spot. Too many top riders are from there. The cobbles of the Paterberg and so much more.
Finlay took the train up from Chamonix via Paris. I took a train from London to Dover and then hopped on the ferry to Dunkirk. We met up in a roadside hotel late that Friday night and set off early with tired eyes, craving espresso and pastries. Needless to say, Dunkirk isn't really the place for that. More of an 8am calvados and cigarette kind of place. But hey! We had our carbs and caffeine and set off.

I had planned a cobble heavy 450km route linking Dunkirk, Ghent, Oudenaarde, Lille and back to Dunkirk (in case we hadn't had enough the first time round).

The route took us along the channel, crossing into Belgium relatively quickly. I hadn't seen Fin in a while, so we had a bunch to catch up on. So much that our first pit stop came quicker than expected: Ostend.

Ostend was everything I could expect from a seaside Belgian town in September. Buildings on the coast looking out on a long flat beach, fast food stands selling chips with mayo and sand covered cycling paths.

The chips were banging, no comment. But god it was hard to order. We had forgotten about the language divide between Flanders and Wallonia: no more French, barely English, only Flemish.

Full of potato and chilli mayo, we pushed on across the Belgian countryside hopping from one cycle path to another all the way to Ghent. On the way we had to dip into Bruges, not to see the hordes of retired American tour groups but to taste some real Belgian waffles. Yes, they were better than the packet waffles I grew up on. Bruges was grab and go. We wanted to get to Ghent.

 we checked into our place but we wasted no time. With only one night in Belgium we had to get on the beers.

> "OMG that one is 12%, lets go"

One. Two. Three. Kaput. We blamed the length of our ride, but the beers were doing the damage.

Hungover, the next day we set out slowly, hoping the cobbles would shake out the bees from the night before. The day was far from smooth**—**I had linked together as many Ronde climbs that I could without looping. Paterberg, Muur van Geraardsbergen, Koppenberg, and the Oude Kwaremont.

Crazy steep. Crazy bumpy. No wonder people race up them. With 80km left on the day we recovered quickly and continued toward the French border along the river. I cannot emphasise how nice the cycle paths are. The type of cycle paths that should make motorists jealous. These belgians have it dialled in.

A loop of the iconic Roubaix track and we slowly made it to Finlay's friend's place who was hosting us for the night. Saturdays in Lille call for one thing: beers. We couldn't say no**—despite wanting the bed.**

Back at 1 a.m., up at 8. We woke early, grabbed burnt coffee in a PMU bar that still smelled like it had been pouring Kronenbourg hours before, and then rode into a headwind, racing just to stay on schedule. The Nord-Pas-de-Calais deliveredeverything it’s known for: endless flatland, potato farms, and stubborn grey skies. Fatigue blurred the ride; conversation faded. We tried to catch a train from there to skip some distance, but French rail strikes kept us in the saddle. We pushed harder, fighting wind and time, and finally rolled back into our original meeting spot from day one.

Given our respective rushes to catch our rides home, we unclipped, hugged and parted ways. Another great adventure, paving (or cobbling) the way for many more to come.
